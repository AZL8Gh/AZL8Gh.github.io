            <h3 class="text-center">About MedMemo</h3>
                <p> MEDmemo is an organization started by a teen in NC after hearing the struggle patients face in remembering appointments and previous vaccinations. Medical information is vital to a patient’s health and being able to recall if a patient has had a vaccination or check-up makes all the difference in ensuring patients are healthy. However, with the constant change of technology in everyday lives, it becomes harder and harder to keep up with newer apps and devices to record down medical information. This product provides patients an easier way of recording down information without worrying about not being able to find the information again. Additionally, this product helps doctors stay efficient in appointments with patients as they will not have to spend as much time searching for a patient’s medical history files. </p>
            <h3 class="text-center">MedMemo Products</h3>    
                <p>MEDmemo journals are half-size (8.5” by 5.5”), spiral-bound, and have a sturdy, waterproof cover. Journal pages were all designed by MEDmemo. Spiral and cover were purchased from outside sources.</p>
            <h3 class="text-center">MedMemo Services</h3>   
                <p>As of right now, MEDmemo journals are hand-made and only located in NC Research Triangle Area doctors’ offices. Additionally, they are free only for offices located in the Research Triangle Area. However, as demand increases, MEDmemo journals will also increase in production and outreach. To get MEDmemo journals in your local area or doctor offices, contact us through the Contact page on our website. Prices may vary on the journals for out of Research Triangle area locations, but our goal is to make them as accessible as possible without any concerns for money. MEDmemo honors itself on its accessibility and affordability. If you believe you have a special case, then contact us and we will do our best to provide for you and your area. </p>
            <h3 class="text-center">Support for MedMemo</h3>   
                <P>The money pays for any shipping costs and some of the production costs. MEDmemo buys supplies from outside retailers to make the journal and the money paid for the product goes directly to the MEDmemo organization to make more products for patients.</P>
